# Ankylosaurus — Reference Materials

## What this folder is for
This folder holds all scientific reference materials for *Ankylosaurus
magniventris*: skeletal diagrams, fossil photographs, osteoderm and armor
studies, tail club biomechanics, and museum specimen images. All content here
supports scientifically accurate prompt engineering.

## File naming convention
```
ankylosaurus_[type]_[source]_[year].[ext]
```
Types: `skeletal`, `fossil`, `reconstruction`, `museum`, `texture`

Examples:
- `ankylosaurus_skeletal_amnh5895_scan.tif`
- `ankylosaurus_fossil_cmn8880_armor.tif`
- `ankylosaurus_reconstruction_arbour_2015.tif`

Image format: minimum 4K resolution; RAW preferred; TIF for scans.

## Priority reference materials

1. **AMNH 5895** — American Museum of Natural History, New York
   Partial skull and postcranial material; includes armor and tail club
   fragments. One of the primary *Ankylosaurus* specimens. Published in
   Brown 1908 and revised by Arbour & Currie 2013.

2. **CMN 8880** — Canadian Museum of Nature, Ottawa
   Skull and partial skeleton; another key specimen for *A. magniventris*.
   Provides good data on skull ornamentation and horn positions.

3. **Arbour & Currie 2015** (PLOS ONE, doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0138258)
   Tail club biomechanics study. Club could generate sufficient force to
   fracture bone of large theropods. Active weapon — not merely passive.
   Includes reconstructed swing mechanics.

4. **Arbour & Currie 2013** (Journal of Systematic Palaeontology)
   Comprehensive revision of *Ankylosaurus*. Best modern anatomical
   description. Essential for skull proportions and armor layout.

5. **Burns et al. 2011** (various)
   Osteoderm ontogeny and distribution. Back and flanks heavily armoured;
   belly was comparatively unprotected — soft ventral region.

6. **Schweitzer et al. (various)** — Ankylosaur skin texture documentation
   Osteoderms (keeled scutes, flat oval scutes) fully covering dorsal
   surface. Photograph surface textures of any ankylosaur specimens
   available at AMNH, RTMP, CMN.

7. **Royal Tyrrell Museum** — Drumheller, Alberta
   Extensive ankylosaur collection including *Euoplocephalus* (close
   relative). Textures from *Euoplocephalus* are the best available proxy
   for *Ankylosaurus* integument. RTMP 80.16.1 is a key skin reference.

## What to look for / photograph / scan

- **Tail club**: Bony knob at tail end (handle vertebrae fused); actively
  swung laterally. Proportionally large and heavy — do not undersize.
- **Armor**: Keeled oval scutes over back and sides in regular rows; large
  horn-like scutes at the shoulders and hips. Small mosaic ossicles fill
  gaps. No armor on belly — soft underside is a vulnerability.
- **Skull**: Wide, triangular, heavily armoured; fused osteoderms on skull
  surface form distinct polygonal bosses. Small, leaf-shaped teeth; broad
  beak. Skull is nearly as wide as long.
- **Posture**: Low to ground; wide-gauge quadrupedal stance; barrel body.
  Forelimbs slightly shorter than hindlimbs.
- **Limbs**: Columnar and robust; five toes on hind feet; broad, flat foot.
- **Texture detail**: Photograph osteoderm keels and surface texture in
  raking light. Scale impressions between osteoderms are useful.

## Image format guidance
- Minimum 4K (3840×2160)
- RAW preferred for museum photography
- TIF for osteoderm surface detail scans
- Raking light setup essential for revealing surface texture on armor scutes

## MJ Prompt Notes — Ankylosaurus

### CLIP-Optimized Shorthand
These comma-separated phrases are what the anatomy module injects into prompts:
```
  massive bony tail club
  interlocking dorsal armor osteoderms
  low flat wide tank body
  four pyramidal skull horns
  lateral triangular body spikes
  armored eyelids
```

### Recommended --stylize Range
| Low | Default | High |
|-----|---------|------|
| 75 | **125** | 250 |

Use `--stylize 125` as a starting point. Lower values (75) preserve more anatomical accuracy. Higher values (250) allow more MJ artistic interpretation.

### Known MJ Failures
Watch for these common misrenders:
- ❌ spiked tail — tail has a bony CLUB, not spikes (spikes are Stegosaurus)
- ❌ tall proportions — body is extremely low, flat, and WIDE like a tank
