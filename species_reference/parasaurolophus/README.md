# Parasaurolophus — Reference Materials

## What this folder is for
This folder holds all scientific reference materials for *Parasaurolophus
walkeri* (and *P. tubicen*, *P. cyrtocristatus*): skeletal diagrams, fossil
photographs, crest acoustics studies, skin impression data (from close
relatives), and museum specimen images. All content here supports
scientifically accurate prompt engineering.

## File naming convention
```
parasaurolophus_[type]_[source]_[year].[ext]
```
Types: `skeletal`, `fossil`, `reconstruction`, `museum`, `texture`

Examples:
- `parasaurolophus_skeletal_rom768_scan.tif`
- `parasaurolophus_fossil_fmnh_p27393_2009.tif`
- `parasaurolophus_reconstruction_weishampel_1981.tif`

Image format: minimum 4K resolution; RAW preferred; TIF for scans.

## Priority reference materials

1. **ROM 768** — Royal Ontario Museum, Toronto
   Type specimen of *P. walkeri* (Parks 1922). This is the reference
   standard for the species. Complete skull with full posterior crest.
   Photograph from lateral and dorsal angles.

2. **FMNH P27393** — Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago
   Well-preserved specimen. Good for body proportions and postcranial
   reference. Field Museum mounts are well-maintained and accessible.

3. **Weishampel 1981** (Paleobiology)
   Crest acoustics paper — modelled the hollow crest as a resonating
   chamber producing low-frequency sound, possibly infrasound. While
   the exact acoustic properties are debated, the resonation function
   is the current consensus. Important context for crest depiction.

4. **Evans et al. 2009** (PLOS ONE, doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0006290)
   Juvenile ontogeny — crest was absent or rudimentary in juveniles and
   grew throughout ontogeny. A juvenile *Parasaurolophus* looks very
   different from an adult. Critical for age-accurate depiction.

5. **Edmontosaurus mummy specimens** (closely related hadrosaurid)
   **AMNH 5060** and **Senckenberg "Leonardo" (MOR 1128)** provide skin
   texture reference. Pebbly mosaic scales with possible pattern variation.
   Use as proxy for *Parasaurolophus* integument.

6. **Horner et al. 2004** (various) — Hadrosaur locomotion and posture
   *Parasaurolophus* was facultatively bipedal: bipedal at speed, could
   drop to all fours at low speed or foraging. Tail held horizontal as
   counterbalance during bipedal locomotion.

7. **Kirtland Formation specimens (New Mexico)**
   *P. tubicen* specimens from NM Museum of Natural History and Science
   (NMMNH). Complement ROM 768 for species variation reference.

## What to look for / photograph / scan

- **Crest**: Long, backward-pointing hollow tube crest in adults; crest
  shape varies by species (*walkeri* is long and straight; *tubicen* is
  longer; *cyrtocristatus* is shorter and curved). Crest is hollow — not
  solid bone. Absent/small in juveniles.
- **Skull**: Duck-billed (wide, flat dental battery); toothless beak at
  front; hundreds of teeth in grinding battery. Large orbit.
- **Skin**: Pebbly mosaic scales based on hadrosaur mummy reference.
  Possible patterned coloration (Edmontosaurus mummies show scale texture
  variation that implies pattern). No feathers.
- **Locomotion posture**: Bipedal when running (tail out for balance);
  quadrupedal when slow/foraging. Not fully bipedal at all times.
- **Tail**: Muscular, horizontal; relatively deep from neural spines;
  active counterbalance in bipedal posture.
- **Forelimbs**: Hoof-like manus for weight-bearing when quadrupedal;
  three functional fingers fused into a padded weight-bearing structure.

## Image format guidance
- Minimum 4K (3840×2160)
- RAW preferred for museum photography
- TIF for skeletal and crest cross-section diagram scans
- CT scan data of ROM 768 crest (published) is useful reference for crest interior

## MJ Prompt Notes — Parasaurolophus

### CLIP-Optimized Shorthand
These comma-separated phrases are what the anatomy module injects into prompts:
```
  long backward-sweeping hollow tubular crest
  broad flat duck-billed beak
  pebbly uniform polygonal scales
  robust hadrosaur body deep tail
  facultative biped browsing on all fours
  9.5m long herd animal
```

### Recommended --stylize Range
| Low | Default | High |
|-----|---------|------|
| 75 | **125** | 250 |

Use `--stylize 125` as a starting point. Lower values (75) preserve more anatomical accuracy. Higher values (250) allow more MJ artistic interpretation.

### Known MJ Failures
Watch for these common misrenders:
- ❌ upward crest — crest sweeps BACKWARD over neck, not pointing upward
- ❌ teeth visible — beak covers front of mouth, no visible teeth from outside
