# Triceratops — Reference Materials

## What this folder is for
This folder holds all scientific reference materials for *Triceratops horridus*
and *T. prorsus*: skeletal diagrams, fossil photographs, skin impression
studies, frill and horn reconstructions, and museum specimen images. All
content here supports scientifically accurate prompt engineering.

## File naming convention
```
triceratops_[type]_[source]_[year].[ext]
```
Types: `skeletal`, `fossil`, `reconstruction`, `museum`, `texture`

Examples:
- `triceratops_skeletal_usnm4842_scan.tif`
- `triceratops_fossil_dmnh1467_2009.tif`
- `triceratops_reconstruction_horner_2009.tif`

Image format: minimum 4K resolution; RAW preferred; TIF for scans.

## Priority reference materials

1. **USNM 4842** — Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, Washington DC
   One of the best-preserved skulls; used as a key reference for *T. horridus*
   proportions. Marsh 1891 holotype material. Good for orbital and nasal
   horn curvature measurements.

2. **DMNH 1467** — Denver Museum of Nature and Science, Denver CO
   Well-preserved specimen. Denver has multiple *Triceratops* specimens
   suitable for skull and postcranial reference.

3. **Horner & Goodwin 2009** (Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology)
   Ontogenetic study — juvenile *Triceratops* have very different frill
   and horn proportions than adults. Critical for age-accurate depictions.
   Subadults had forward-curved horns that straightened/lengthened with age.

4. **Fujiwara 2009** (Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, doi:10.1671/039.029.0413)
   Forelimb posture analysis. Elbows were slightly lateral — semi-sprawling,
   not columnar like an elephant, not flat like a lizard. Critical for
   accurate front-view and three-quarter poses.

5. **Longrich & Field 2012** (PLOS ONE) — *Torosaurus* synonymy debate
   Context: *Torosaurus* may be the mature form of *Triceratops*. Relevant
   for understanding frill fenestra development at oldest ontogenetic stages.

6. **Farke 2011** (PLOS ONE, doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0018112)
   Frill vascularization and display function. The frill was richly
   vascularised — likely brightly coloured for intraspecific display and
   possibly thermoregulation.

7. **Skin impressions** — pebbly/mosaic scale texture documented from
   multiple *Triceratops* and *Torosaurus* specimens. Photograph Smithsonian
   and Denver holdings.

## What to look for / photograph / scan

- **Skull**: Enormous relative to body (~2 m long); three horns; curved
  frill edge (epiparietals); massive jugal "cheek" bosses.
- **Horns**: Nasal horn is short and blunt; brow horns are long, forward-
  curving in adults. Juvenile horns curve differently — specify age.
- **Frill**: Large, solid (not fenestrated like *Torosaurus*); margin
  decorated with small ossified triangular epiparietals/epijugals.
- **Forelimbs**: Semi-sprawling posture; elbows slightly out and slightly
  bent, not locked straight. Careful not to draw as elephant-columnar.
- **Skin**: Pebbly mosaic scales; no osteoderms on back. No feathers.
- **Overall proportions**: Massive barrel body; relatively short tail;
  four stocky legs. Hindlimbs longer than forelimbs (slight forward pitch).

## Image format guidance
- Minimum 4K (3840×2160)
- RAW preferred for museum photography
- TIF for skeletal diagram scans
- Photograph skull from multiple angles: lateral, dorsal, anterior, posterior

## MJ Prompt Notes — Triceratops

### CLIP-Optimized Shorthand
These comma-separated phrases are what the anatomy module injects into prompts:
```
  three-horned skull with solid bony frill
  parrot-like keratinous beak
  pebbly rosette-patterned scales
  rhino-proportioned stocky quadruped
  semi-erect forelimbs elbows bowed out
  9m long 9-tonne ceratopsian
```

### Recommended --stylize Range
| Low | Default | High |
|-----|---------|------|
| 50 | **100** | 200 |

Use `--stylize 100` as a starting point. Lower values (50) preserve more anatomical accuracy. Higher values (200) allow more MJ artistic interpretation.

### Known MJ Failures
Watch for these common misrenders:
- ❌ fenestrated frill — Triceratops frill is SOLID bone, not windowed
- ❌ sprawling lizard limbs — forelimbs semi-erect with elbows bowed out, not sprawling
- ❌ too few horns — must have two long brow horns plus one shorter nose horn
