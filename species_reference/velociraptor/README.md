# Velociraptor — Reference Materials

## What this folder is for
This folder holds all scientific reference materials for *Velociraptor
mongoliensis* (and *V. osmolskae*): skeletal diagrams, fossil photographs,
feather and integument studies, life reconstructions, and museum specimen
images. All content here supports scientifically accurate prompt engineering.

## File naming convention
```
velociraptor_[type]_[source]_[year].[ext]
```
Types: `skeletal`, `fossil`, `reconstruction`, `museum`, `texture`

Examples:
- `velociraptor_skeletal_paul_2010.tif`
- `velociraptor_fossil_igm100_986_2007.tif`
- `velociraptor_reconstruction_turner_2007.tif`

Image format: minimum 4K resolution; RAW preferred; TIF for scans.

## Priority reference materials

1. **IGM 100/986** — Institute of Geology, Mongolian Academy of Sciences
   Type specimen of *V. mongoliensis* (Osborn 1924). Key for skull
   proportions: elongated, low snout; large orbit; denticulate teeth.
   Well-illustrated in Novas & Pol 2005.

2. **IGM 100/1126 — Quill knob specimen**
   Ulna of *V. mongoliensis* with six quill knob attachment points
   (papillae) along the posterior edge. Published Turner et al. 2007
   (Science, doi:10.1126/science.1137427). This specimen proves
   large pennaceous forearm feathers — directly analogous to modern
   bird secondary feathers. Photograph this ulna if possible.

3. **"Fighting Dinosaurs" IGM 100/25** — Institute of Geology, Ulaanbaatar
   Articulated specimen locked with *Protoceratops* — preserves sickle
   claw in context. Shows natural resting limb posture in death.

4. **Turner et al. 2007** (Science)
   Foundational quill knob paper. Establishes full-body feathering
   inference from phylogenetic bracketing of maniraptorans.

5. **Manning et al. 2006** (Biology Letters, doi:10.1098/rsbl.2005.0395)
   Sickle claw function study: claw used for grip/pin, not slashing.
   Claw was held elevated off the ground during normal locomotion.

6. **Pittman et al. 2022** (iScience, doi:10.1016/j.isci.2022.104358)
   Ecological niche analysis. *Velociraptor* was a small-prey ambush
   predator, NOT a pack hunter of large animals. Jurassic Park depiction
   is incorrect in both size and behaviour.

7. **Greg Paul skeletal** — *The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs* (2010)
   Best widely-available skeletal for body outline and proportions.

## What to look for / photograph / scan

- **Overall size**: *Velociraptor* was turkey-sized (~1.8 m, 18 kg).
  Collect size-comparison references against known objects for scale accuracy.
- **Skull**: Low, elongated, upturned at tip; teeth are small, recurved,
  and serrated; large antorbital fenestra.
- **Sickle claw**: Second pedal digit; claw held raised off the ground.
  Photograph cast or real specimen of digit II hyperextension.
- **Forelimbs**: Three-fingered manus with large claws; arm proportionally
  long; wrist folds bird-like (semilunate carpal). Palms face each other
  at rest, not downward.
- **Feathers**: Full-body plumage strongly inferred. Arm feathers are large
  (secondary-like). Tail feathers likely. Reconstruct with modern bird
  feather textures as reference, but avoid overly "fluffy" appearance.
- **Tail**: Ossified tendons made it stiff and horizontal. Cannot curve
  significantly up or down.

## Image format guidance
- Minimum 4K (3840×2160) for usable reference
- RAW preferred for fossil photography
- TIF (16-bit, uncompressed) for skeletal diagram scans
- High-res bird feather macro photography is useful for texture reference

## MJ Prompt Notes — Velociraptor

### CLIP-Optimized Shorthand
These comma-separated phrases are what the anatomy module injects into prompts:
```
  fully feathered turkey-sized raptor
  sickle claw on raised second toe
  long narrow feathered snout
  feathered wing-like arms folded at rest
  long rigid bony-rod tail
  desert-camouflage plumage
```

### Recommended --stylize Range
| Low | Default | High |
|-----|---------|------|
| 50 | **100** | 175 |

Use `--stylize 100` as a starting point. Lower values (50) preserve more anatomical accuracy. Higher values (175) allow more MJ artistic interpretation.

### Known MJ Failures
Watch for these common misrenders:
- ❌ scaly Velociraptor — MJ defaults to Jurassic Park scaly version; must specify feathered
- ❌ human-sized — MJ renders too large; must specify turkey-sized
- ❌ arms held straight out — correct is folded bird-like at rest
- ❌ Jurassic Park frill — Velociraptor had no frill or display structures
