# Stegosaurus — Reference Materials

## What this folder is for
This folder holds all scientific reference materials for *Stegosaurus stenops*
and *S. ungulatus*: skeletal diagrams, fossil photographs, plate and thagomizer
studies, skin impression data, and museum specimen images. All content here
supports scientifically accurate prompt engineering.

## File naming convention
```
stegosaurus_[type]_[source]_[year].[ext]
```
Types: `skeletal`, `fossil`, `reconstruction`, `museum`, `texture`

Examples:
- `stegosaurus_skeletal_usnm4934_scan.tif`
- `stegosaurus_fossil_nhm_sophie_2014.tif`
- `stegosaurus_reconstruction_mallison_2011.tif`

Image format: minimum 4K resolution; RAW preferred; TIF for scans.

## Priority reference materials

1. **USNM 4934** — Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, Washington DC
   Classic mounted specimen; important historical reference for overall
   body proportions and plate arrangement. Note: older mounts have
   plate arrangement errors — use Mallison 2011 for corrected kinematics.

2. **NHM London "Sophie" (NHMUK PV R36730)** — Natural History Museum, London
   Most complete *Stegosaurus* skeleton known (~85%). Note: this is the
   specimen sometimes mis-cited as "DMNH 1483" — "Sophie" is in London, not
   Denver. Published fully in Maidment et al. 2015. Excellent for proportions.

3. **Saitta 2018** (PLOS ONE, doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0200)
   Plate sexual dimorphism study: two distinct plate morphotypes may
   indicate male (tall, narrow plates) and female (wide, flat plates).
   If depicting a specific sex, choose the correct plate shape.

4. **Mallison 2011** (PLOS ONE, doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0014665)
   Tail kinematics — thagomizer could swing laterally with significant
   force. Active weapon, not passive decoration. Models tail as raised
   and mobile in alert/defensive posture.

5. **Farlow et al. 1976** (Paleobiology)
   Original plate function paper. Plates were vascularised — grooves for
   blood vessels visible on specimen surfaces. Display and/or
   thermoregulation were primary functions.

6. **DMNH specimens** — Denver Museum of Nature and Science
   Multiple Morrison Formation *Stegosaurus* specimens. Denver collection
   is strong for postcranial and plate reference.

7. **Skin impressions** — ossicles (small, non-overlapping) and larger
   tubercles documented. Photograph from Morrison Formation specimens.

## What to look for / photograph / scan

- **Plates**: Two rows, alternating (not paired). Plates are covered in
  grooved vascular tissue — not smooth bone. Plate shape: address both
  morphotypes for your specific specimen.
- **Thagomizer**: Four tail spikes, in two pairs angled outward. Spikes
  are keratinous sheaths over bone — longer in life than the fossil bone.
  Tail is raised and active, not dragging.
- **Head**: Tiny relative to body; small, leaf-shaped teeth; toothless
  beak at front. Brain genuinely small — secondary neural canal in hips
  was a glycogen body, not a second brain.
- **Forelimbs**: Short and columnar. Hindlimbs significantly longer —
  rump is the highest point of the body. Plantigrade hindfoot.
- **Skin**: Scales, ossicles, and tubercles. No feathers, no smooth skin.
- **Overall posture**: Deep body; short neck; rounded back profile with
  plates rising above. Four short, stocky legs.

## Image format guidance
- Minimum 4K (3840×2160)
- RAW preferred for fossil photography
- TIF for skeletal and plate diagram scans
- Photograph plate surfaces at raking light angle to reveal vascular groove texture

## MJ Prompt Notes — Stegosaurus

### CLIP-Optimized Shorthand
These comma-separated phrases are what the anatomy module injects into prompts:
```
  staggered diamond dorsal plates alternating left-right
  four tail spikes thagomizer
  absurdly tiny head held low
  arched back peaking over hips
  pebbly scales with embedded osteoderms
  bus-sized quadruped sloping forward
```

### Recommended --stylize Range
| Low | Default | High |
|-----|---------|------|
| 75 | **125** | 250 |

Use `--stylize 125` as a starting point. Lower values (75) preserve more anatomical accuracy. Higher values (250) allow more MJ artistic interpretation.

### Known MJ Failures
Watch for these common misrenders:
- ❌ paired symmetrical plates — plates alternate LEFT-RIGHT, not paired side-by-side
- ❌ too many tail spikes — exactly four spikes (thagomizer), not six or eight
- ❌ head held high — tiny head should be held very low near ground level
