# Dilophosaurus — Reference Materials

## What this folder is for
This folder holds all scientific reference materials for *Dilophosaurus
wetherilli*: skeletal diagrams, fossil photographs, crest morphology studies,
locomotion data, and museum specimen images. All content here supports
scientifically accurate prompt engineering.

**CRITICAL ACCURACY WARNING — Jurassic Park depiction is incorrect**:
*Dilophosaurus* in Jurassic Park (1993) was depicted with a neck frill and
venom-spitting ability. NEITHER has any scientific basis:
- **No frill**: No frill attachment structures exist in any *Dilophosaurus*
  specimen. The frill was pure Hollywood invention.
- **No venom**: No venom delivery structures (grooved/hollow teeth, venom
  glands) are known in any theropod dinosaur.
These errors must never appear in any reconstruction derived from this
reference collection.

## File naming convention
```
dilophosaurus_[type]_[source]_[year].[ext]
```
Types: `skeletal`, `fossil`, `reconstruction`, `museum`, `texture`

Examples:
- `dilophosaurus_skeletal_ucmp37302_scan.tif`
- `dilophosaurus_fossil_kayenta_az_welles_1984.tif`
- `dilophosaurus_reconstruction_marsh_2020.tif`

Image format: minimum 4K resolution; RAW preferred; TIF for scans.

## Priority reference materials

1. **UCMP 37302** — University of California Museum of Paleontology, Berkeley
   Holotype specimen described by Welles 1954. Partial postcranial skeleton.
   This specimen established *D. wetherilli* as a valid species.

2. **Welles 1984** (Palaeontographica Abteilung A)
   Full redescription and revision of *Dilophosaurus wetherilli*. The
   authoritative anatomical reference for the species. Essential reading
   before any reconstruction work. Confirms NO frill, NO venom structures.

3. **Marsh 2020 comprehensive revision** — Adam Marsh's detailed
   re-examination of all *Dilophosaurus* specimens from the Kayenta
   Formation. Updates Welles 1984 with CT scanning and modern methods.
   Best current source for skull and crest anatomy.

4. **MNA V2623** — Museum of Northern Arizona, Flagstaff AZ
   Specimen from the original Kayenta Formation quarry site. MNA holds
   significant *Dilophosaurus* material from Navajo Nation lands.

5. **Parsons & Parsons 2009** (various)
   Postcranial material and locomotion inferences. *Dilophosaurus* was an
   active, long-legged biped — one of the larger Early Jurassic theropods.

6. **IVPP material — *Dilophosaurus sinensis*** — Institute of Vertebrate
   Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, Beijing
   Chinese specimens from Yunnan Province. Second species (or close
   relative). Useful for comparative reference and variation.

7. **Early Jurassic theropod context** — Compare with *Coelophysis*
   (AMNH collections) and *Zupaysaurus* for proportional reference within
   early theropod body plans.

## What to look for / photograph / scan

- **Double crests**: Two parallel, longitudinal crests on top of the skull.
  Thin, fragile bone — likely for display/species recognition only. Cannot
  have been used for combat (too fragile). No frill attachment fossae.
- **Skull**: Large, lightly built; relatively long; notch in upper jaw
  behind the front teeth (subnarial gap) — unusual feature. Small, blade-
  like serrated teeth.
- **Body proportions**: Lightly built for its size; long hindlimbs; long
  neck; relatively long arms with three large-clawed fingers plus a reduced
  fourth.
- **Forelimbs**: Three functional clawed fingers; arms long relative to
  later theropods. Palms face each other (medially).
- **Feathering**: Uncertain — possible proto-feathers (as in *Sinosauropteryx*
  grade). No direct evidence known, but phylogenetic position makes it
  plausible. Skin impressions are unknown.
- **Tail**: Long, horizontal counterbalance; important for bipedal balance.
- **Overall impression**: Gracile, active predator — more lightly built
  than later large theropods. Think falcon-like in movement quality.

## Image format guidance
- Minimum 4K (3840×2160)
- RAW preferred for museum photography
- TIF for skeletal and skull diagram scans
- Crest photography: multiple angles, raking light to reveal thin bone structure

## MJ Prompt Notes — Dilophosaurus

### CLIP-Optimized Shorthand
These comma-separated phrases are what the anatomy module injects into prompts:
```
  twin parallel bony head crests
  gracile lean 7m biped predator
  kinked jaw with subnarial notch
  no frill no venom
  recurved serrated blade teeth
  long thin horizontal tail
```

### Recommended --stylize Range
| Low | Default | High |
|-----|---------|------|
| 50 | **100** | 175 |

Use `--stylize 100` as a starting point. Lower values (50) preserve more anatomical accuracy. Higher values (175) allow more MJ artistic interpretation.

### Known MJ Failures
Watch for these common misrenders:
- ❌ neck frill — Jurassic Park invention, Dilophosaurus had NO frill whatsoever
- ❌ spitting venom — Jurassic Park invention, no venom capability
- ❌ small size — JP version is dog-sized; real Dilophosaurus was 7m and 400kg
