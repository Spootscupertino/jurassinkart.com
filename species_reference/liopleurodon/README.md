# Liopleurodon — Reference Materials

## What this folder is for
This folder holds all scientific reference materials for *Liopleurodon ferox*:
skeletal diagrams, fossil photographs, life reconstructions, museum specimen
images, and texture studies. Everything here feeds directly into
scientifically accurate prompt engineering for Liopleurodon art generation.

## File naming convention
```
liopleurodon_[type]_[source]_[year].[ext]
```
Types: `skeletal`, `fossil`, `reconstruction`, `museum`, `texture`

Examples:
- `liopleurodon_skeletal_nhmuk_2013.pdf`
- `liopleurodon_fossil_sauvage_1873.tif`
- `liopleurodon_reconstruction_oneill_2019.tif`
- `liopleurodon_texture_skin_study_2016.tif`

Image format: minimum 4K resolution; RAW preferred for photography; TIF for
flatbed or photogrammetric scans.

## Real Animal Analogues for --sref

Use photographs of these living animals to supply `--sref` style references
for specific body regions and surface qualities:

- **Orca** (*Orcinus orca*) — overall bulk, predator posture, and body mass
  distribution. Photograph full lateral profile at the surface and
  underwater; capture the sense of mass and muscular torso.
- **Great white shark** (*Carcharodon carcharias*) — jaw structure and gape
  proportions. Photograph open jaw from frontal and three-quarter angles;
  detail shots of tooth rows and jaw articulation.
- **Saltwater crocodile** (*Crocodylus porosus*) — teeth shape, tooth
  spacing, and skin/scale texture. Photograph teeth in situ from lateral
  angle; close-up of dorsal and ventral hide texture at high magnification.

## Image format guidance
- Minimum 4K (3840x2160) for usable reference
- RAW (.CR3, .ARW, .NEF) preferred for fossil and museum photography
- TIF (16-bit, uncompressed) for flatbed scans of skeletal diagrams
- PDF acceptable for published skeletal reconstructions

## MJ Prompt Notes — Liopleurodon

### CLIP-Optimized Shorthand
These comma-separated phrases are what the anatomy module injects into prompts:
```
  massive head quarter of body length
  short thick neck barrel body
  four powerful hydrofoil flippers
  robust conical gripping teeth
  smooth hydrodynamic marine hide
  6-7m short-necked pliosaur
```

### Recommended --stylize Range
| Low | Default | High |
|-----|---------|------|
| 100 | **150** | 300 |

Use `--stylize 150` as a starting point. Lower values (100) preserve more anatomical accuracy. Higher values (300) allow more MJ artistic interpretation.

### Known MJ Failures
Watch for these common misrenders:
- ❌ 25m size — Walking With Dinosaurs MASSIVELY exaggerated; real size was 6-7m
- ❌ long neck — Liopleurodon is a SHORT-necked pliosaur, opposite of Elasmosaurus
