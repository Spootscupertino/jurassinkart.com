# Spinosaurus — Reference Materials

## What this folder is for
This folder holds all scientific reference materials for *Spinosaurus
aegyptiacus*: skeletal diagrams, specimen photographs, semi-aquatic lifestyle
studies, tail reconstruction data, and museum specimen images. All content
here supports scientifically accurate prompt engineering.

**HISTORICAL NOTE**: The original *Spinosaurus* holotype specimens (collected
by Ernst Stromer, 1912, Egypt) were destroyed in April 1944 during the Allied
bombing of Munich (Alte Akademie). All modern *Spinosaurus* reconstructions
are based on subsequently discovered Moroccan/Algerian specimens and Stromer's
original descriptions and photographs.

## File naming convention
```
spinosaurus_[type]_[source]_[year].[ext]
```
Types: `skeletal`, `fossil`, `reconstruction`, `museum`, `texture`

Examples:
- `spinosaurus_skeletal_ibrahim_2020_nature.tif`
- `spinosaurus_fossil_msnm_v4047_2014.tif`
- `spinosaurus_reconstruction_ibrahim_2020.tif`

Image format: minimum 4K resolution; RAW preferred; TIF for scans.

## Priority reference materials

1. **MSNM V4047** — Museo di Storia Naturale di Milano, Milan
   Snout material; one of the well-documented post-Stromer specimens.
   Published in Dal Sasso et al. 2005. Conical, elongated crocodile-like
   snout confirmed; rosette of teeth at tip.

2. **Ibrahim et al. 2014** (Science, doi:10.1126/science.1258750)
   Landmark semi-aquatic reconstruction paper. Describes short hindlimbs,
   dense (pachyostotic) bones, and elevated nares position. Introduced
   the quadrupedal "gorilla posture" interpretation. Key images available.

3. **Ibrahim et al. 2020** (Nature, doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2190-3)
   Paddle-tail reconstruction. New specimen from Kem Kem shows elongated
   neural spines on tail vertebrae forming a large fin-like paddle.
   Primary swimming organ interpretation. This is the current standard
   for tail reconstruction.

4. **Hone & Holtz 2021** (Palaeontologia Electronica)
   Critical reassessment — argues for wading/shoreline predator rather
   than fully aquatic. Debate is ongoing. Note this uncertainty in any
   strictly aquatic depictions.

5. **Kem Kem Beds specimens** — Multiple fragmentary specimens from
   Morocco/Algeria (Kem Kem Group, Cenomanian). Various institutions
   hold material. The National Geographic Society funded the Ibrahim 2020
   excavation.

6. **Stromer 1915 original description** (Abhandlungen der Königlichen
   Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften) — Available in translation.
   Provides original documentation of the destroyed holotype. Scale
   drawings by Stromer are the only direct record of those specimens.

7. **Scale impressions** — Conical scales documented from available
   *Spinosaurus* specimens. Not smooth-skinned; not feathered.

## What to look for / photograph / scan

- **Skull**: Long, narrow, low profile — crocodilian analogue. Conical,
  interlocking teeth (not serrated blades). Enlarged conical teeth at snout
  tip (rosette). Nares positioned posteriorly/dorsally on skull.
- **Neural spines**: Elongated spines on dorsal vertebrae forming a sail
  or hump. Scale and shape still debated — sail vs. muscular hump.
  On tail: enlarged into paddle-like structure (Ibrahim 2020).
- **Hindlimbs**: Notably short relative to body length compared to other
  large theropods. Proportionally stubby.
- **Forelimbs**: Large, three-fingered; used in quadrupedal locomotion on
  land per Ibrahim 2014 interpretation. Claws robust.
- **Aquatic adaptations**: Dense bones; paddle tail; possible swimming
  stroke analogous to modern crocodilians.
- **Scale texture**: Conical scales on available specimens. Photograph
  any specimen with scale impressions at high magnification.

## Image format guidance
- Minimum 4K (3840×2160)
- RAW preferred for museum and field photography
- TIF for skeletal and vertebra diagram scans
- Underwater photography reference (crocodilians) useful for aquatic pose reference

## MJ Prompt Notes — Spinosaurus

### CLIP-Optimized Shorthand
These comma-separated phrases are what the anatomy module injects into prompts:
```
  massive dorsal sail 1.7m tall neural spines
  elongated crocodile-like narrow snout
  deep paddle-shaped eel-like tail fin
  conical unserrated fish-catching teeth
  low quadrupedal stance small hindlimbs
  14m semi-aquatic sail-backed predator
```

### Recommended --stylize Range
| Low | Default | High |
|-----|---------|------|
| 50 | **100** | 200 |

Use `--stylize 100` as a starting point. Lower values (50) preserve more anatomical accuracy. Higher values (200) allow more MJ artistic interpretation.

### Known MJ Failures
Watch for these common misrenders:
- ❌ crocodilian body — 'crocodilian' triggers crocodile rendering; use 'crocodile-like snout' only
- ❌ bipedal stance — hindlimbs too short; quadrupedal on land, swimming in water
- ❌ no sail — sail is THE defining feature, must always be prominent
- ❌ serrated teeth — teeth are conical and UNserrated, for catching fish
