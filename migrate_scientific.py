## Priority reference materials

1. **FMNH PR 2081 "Sue"** — Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago
   Most complete T. rex known (~90%). Full mounted skeleton on public display.
   Photograph the skull separately (FMNH has a separate skull display with
   the correct articulation). Note: the mounted skeleton uses an incorrect
   fibula; verified in Brochu 2003.

2. **RSM P.2523.8 "Scotty"** — Royal Saskatchewan Museum, Canada
   Largest T. rex by body mass estimate (~8,800 kg). Good for overall
   proportions of a fully mature individual. Published fully in Scott et al.
   2019 (PeerJ).

3. **MOR 980 "B-rex"** — Museum of the Rockies, Bozeman MT
   Female specimen with medullary bone evidence. Key for understanding
   sexual dimorphism. Horner & Padian 2004 (Proceedings of the Royal Society).

4. **AMNH 5027** — American Museum of Natural History, New York
   Historic specimen; older mount but skull is well-preserved and
   extensively studied. Good early reference for skull shape cross-checking.

5. **Bell et al. 2017 skin study** (PLOS Biology, doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.1002467)
   Describes scales confirmed from neck, abdomen, hips, and tail base.
   Critical: no feather evidence in adults. Source all illustrated body
   regions from this paper.

6. **Persons & Currie 2011** (Acta Palaeontologica Polonica, doi:10.4202/app.2009.0055)
   Tail musculature reconstruction. Confirms M. caudofemoralis bulk —
   tail must be drawn as deeply muscled, horizontal, clear of the ground.

7. **Hutchinson & Garcia 2002** (Nature, doi:10.1038/nature01138)
   Locomotion biomechanics. Max speed 12–25 km/h. T. rex was a slow,
   deliberate mover — not a sprinter. Important for action pose accuracy.

## What to look for / photograph / scan

- **Skull**: Binocular vision orbit orientation; deep postorbital boss;
  serrated, banana-thick teeth (D-shaped cross-section, not blade-like);
  fenestrae proportions; short foreshortened snout of mature adults.
- **Forelimbs**: Two-fingered manus; extreme reduction; palms face each
  other (medially), NOT downward. Supination was anatomically impossible.
- **Hindlimbs**: Proportionally massive femur vs tibia; arctometatarsalian
  foot (third metatarsal pinched at top); four toes, first digit vestigial.
- **Tail**: Deep base reflecting massive M. caudofemoralis; horizontal
  posture confirmed. Avoid any sag or dragging.
- **Integument**: Scales only in all known adult skin patches. Photograph
  the Bell et al. specimen regions. Scale texture is pebbly/mosaic.
- **Size context**: Scan full skeletal mounts alongside human silhouette
  for scale reference. Sue stands ~3.66 m at the hips.

## Image format guidance

## Priority reference materials

1. **IGM 100/986** — Institute of Geology, Mongolian Academy of Sciences
   Type specimen of *V. mongoliensis* (Osborn 1924). Key for skull
   proportions: elongated, low snout; large orbit; denticulate teeth.
   Well-illustrated in Novas & Pol 2005.

2. **IGM 100/1126 — Quill knob specimen**
   Ulna of *V. mongoliensis* with six quill knob attachment points
   (papillae) along the posterior edge. Published Turner et al. 2007
   (Science, doi:10.1126/science.1137427). This specimen proves
   large pennaceous forearm feathers — directly analogous to modern
   bird secondary feathers. Photograph this ulna if possible.

3. **"Fighting Dinosaurs" IGM 100/25** — Institute of Geology, Ulaanbaatar
   Articulated specimen locked with *Protoceratops* — preserves sickle
   claw in context. Shows natural resting limb posture in death.

4. **Turner et al. 2007** (Science)
   Foundational quill knob paper. Establishes full-body feathering
   inference from phylogenetic bracketing of maniraptorans.

5. **Manning et al. 2006** (Biology Letters, doi:10.1098/rsbl.2005.0395)
   Sickle claw function study: claw used for grip/pin, not slashing.
   Claw was held elevated off the ground during normal locomotion.

6. **Pittman et al. 2022** (iScience, doi:10.1016/j.isci.2022.104358)
   Ecological niche analysis. *Velociraptor* was a small-prey ambush
   predator, NOT a pack hunter of large animals. Jurassic Park depiction
   is incorrect in both size and behaviour.

7. **Greg Paul skeletal** — *The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs* (2010)
   Best widely-available skeletal for body outline and proportions.

## What to look for / photograph / scan

- **Overall size**: *Velociraptor* was turkey-sized (~1.8 m, 18 kg).
  Collect size-comparison references against known objects for scale accuracy.
- **Skull**: Low, elongated, upturned at tip; teeth are small, recurved,
  and serrated; large antorbital fenestra.
- **Sickle claw**: Second pedal digit; claw held raised off the ground.
  Photograph cast or real specimen of digit II hyperextension.
- **Forelimbs**: Three-fingered manus with large claws; arm proportionally
  long; wrist folds bird-like (semilunate carpal). Palms face each other
  at rest, not downward.
- **Feathers**: Full-body plumage strongly inferred. Arm feathers are large
  (secondary-like). Tail feathers likely. Reconstruct with modern bird
  feather textures as reference, but avoid overly "fluffy" appearance.
- **Tail**: Ossified tendons made it stiff and horizontal. Cannot curve
  significantly up or down.

## Image format guidance

Image format: minimum 4K resolution; RAW preferred; TIF for scans.

## Priority reference materials

1. **USNM 4842** — Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, Washington DC
   One of the best-preserved skulls; used as a key reference for *T. horridus*
   proportions. Marsh 1891 holotype material. Good for orbital and nasal
   horn curvature measurements.

2. **DMNH 1467** — Denver Museum of Nature and Science, Denver CO
   Well-preserved specimen. Denver has multiple *Triceratops* specimens
   suitable for skull and postcranial reference.

3. **Horner & Goodwin 2009** (Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology)
   Ontogenetic study — juvenile *Triceratops* have very different frill
   and horn proportions than adults. Critical for age-accurate depictions.
   Subadults had forward-curved horns that straightened/lengthened with age.

4. **Fujiwara 2009** (Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, doi:10.1671/039.029.0413)
   Forelimb posture analysis. Elbows were slightly lateral — semi-sprawling,
   not columnar like an elephant, not flat like a lizard. Critical for
   accurate front-view and three-quarter poses.

5. **Longrich & Field 2012** (PLOS ONE) — *Torosaurus* synonymy debate
   Context: *Torosaurus* may be the mature form of *Triceratops*. Relevant
   for understanding frill fenestra development at oldest ontogenetic stages.

6. **Farke 2011** (PLOS ONE, doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0018112)
   Frill vascularization and display function. The frill was richly
   vascularised — likely brightly coloured for intraspecific display and
   possibly thermoregulation.

7. **Skin impressions** — pebbly/mosaic scale texture documented from
   multiple *Triceratops* and *Torosaurus* specimens. Photograph Smithsonian
   and Denver holdings.

## What to look for / photograph / scan

- **Skull**: Enormous relative to body (~2 m long); three horns; curved
  frill edge (epiparietals); massive jugal "cheek" bosses.
- **Horns**: Nasal horn is short and blunt; brow horns are long, forward-
  curving in adults. Juvenile horns curve differently — specify age.
- **Frill**: Large, solid (not fenestrated like *Torosaurus*); margin
  decorated with small ossified triangular epiparietals/epijugals.
- **Forelimbs**: Semi-sprawling posture; elbows slightly out and slightly
  bent, not locked straight. Careful not to draw as elephant-columnar.
- **Skin**: Pebbly mosaic scales; no osteoderms on back. No feathers.
- **Overall proportions**: Massive barrel body; relatively short tail;
  four stocky legs. Hindlimbs longer than forelimbs (slight forward pitch).

Image format: minimum 4K resolution; RAW preferred; TIF for scans.

## Priority reference materials

1. **USNM 4934** — Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, Washington DC
   Classic mounted specimen; important historical reference for overall
   body proportions and plate arrangement. Note: older mounts have
   plate arrangement errors — use Mallison 2011 for corrected kinematics.

2. **NHM London "Sophie" (NHMUK PV R36730)** — Natural History Museum, London
   Most complete *Stegosaurus* skeleton known (~85%). Note: this is the
   specimen sometimes mis-cited as "DMNH 1483" — "Sophie" is in London, not
   Denver. Published fully in Maidment et al. 2015. Excellent for proportions.

3. **Saitta 2018** (PLOS ONE, doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0200)
   Plate sexual dimorphism study: two distinct plate morphotypes may
   indicate male (tall, narrow plates) and female (wide, flat plates).
   If depicting a specific sex, choose the correct plate shape.

4. **Mallison 2011** (PLOS ONE, doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0014665)
   Tail kinematics — thagomizer could swing laterally with significant
   force. Active weapon, not passive decoration. Models tail as raised
   and mobile in alert/defensive posture.

5. **Farlow et al. 1976** (Paleobiology)
   Original plate function paper. Plates were vascularised — grooves for
   blood vessels visible on specimen surfaces. Display and/or
   thermoregulation were primary functions.

6. **DMNH specimens** — Denver Museum of Nature and Science
   Multiple Morrison Formation *Stegosaurus* specimens. Denver collection
   is strong for postcranial and plate reference.

7. **Skin impressions** — ossicles (small, non-overlapping) and larger
   tubercles documented. Photograph from Morrison Formation specimens.

## What to look for / photograph / scan

- **Plates**: Two rows, alternating (not paired). Plates are covered in
  grooved vascular tissue — not smooth bone. Plate shape: address both
  morphotypes for your specific specimen.
- **Thagomizer**: Four tail spikes, in two pairs angled outward. Spikes
  are keratinous sheaths over bone — longer in life than the fossil bone.
  Tail is raised and active, not dragging.
- **Head**: Tiny relative to body; small, leaf-shaped teeth; toothless
  beak at front. Brain genuinely small — secondary neural canal in hips
  was a glycogen body, not a second brain.
- **Forelimbs**: Short and columnar. Hindlimbs significantly longer —
  rump is the highest point of the body. Plantigrade hindfoot.
- **Skin**: Scales, ossicles, and tubercles. No feathers, no smooth skin.
- **Overall posture**: Deep body; short neck; rounded back profile with
  plates rising above. Four short, stocky legs.

## Image format guidance
- Minimum 4K (3840×2160)

**IMPORTANT**: African specimens (Tendaguru Formation, Tanzania) previously
assigned to *Brachiosaurus brancai* are now a separate genus: *Giraffatitan
brancai* (Taylor 2009). The famous Berlin HMN SII skeleton is *Giraffatitan*,

## Priority reference materials

1. **FMNH P25107** — Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago
   Partial skeleton including forelimb, scapulocoracoid, sacrum — key
   material for *B. altithorax*. The type locality is Fruita, Colorado
   (Morrison Formation, Brushy Basin Member, ~150 Ma).

2. **Taylor 2009** (Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, doi:10.1671/039.029.0401)
   The paper separating *Brachiosaurus* from *Giraffatitan*. Essential
   reading for understanding what's genuinely known about each genus.
   Detailed anatomical differences: pubis shape, dorsal vertebrae, humerus.

3. **HMN SII (Giraffatitan reference)** — Museum für Naturkunde, Berlin
   While this is *Giraffatitan*, it provides the best complete brachiosaur
   body plan reference available. Use cautiously, noting the anatomical
   differences documented by Taylor 2009.

4. **Paul & Christiansen 2000** (Paleobiology)
   Sauropod forelimb and neck posture. Neck was held at elevated angle
   (approximately 45–70° above horizontal) — not horizontal as in older
   depictions and *Jurassic Park*. Supported by osteological neutral pose.

5. **Taylor, Wedel & Naish 2009** (Acta Palaeontologica Polonica)
   Neck posture analysis across sauropods. Confirms elevated neck posture
   as default. Head was held high — this is the defining visual feature.

6. **Carrano 2005** (Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology)
   Locomotion and body mass estimates for large sauropods. Body mass for
   *B. altithorax* estimated ~40,000 kg (40 tonnes).

7. **Greg Paul skeletal** — *The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs* (2010)
   Best widely-available skeletal reconstruction showing elevated neck and
   correct body proportions.

## What to look for / photograph / scan

- **Neck**: Long, elevated at ~45–70° from horizontal. Head small relative
  to body. Not horizontal as in diplodocids. Cervical vertebrae are long
  and pneumatized (air-sac system).
- **Forelimb/hindlimb ratio**: Forelimbs are longer than hindlimbs —
  defining *Brachiosauridae* feature, unlike most other sauropods.
  Results in a distinctly giraffe-like forward shoulder pitch.
- **Forelimbs**: Columnar, near-vertical. Manus (hand) is narrow and
  horseshoe-shaped in prints — no large claws except on first digit.
- **Tail**: Relatively short for a sauropod; tapers to a thin whip end.
  Horizontal, not raised. Not used as a prop.
- **Nostrils**: Bony nares are on the top of the skull, but soft-tissue
  nostrils were likely positioned lower on the snout (Witmer 2001).
- **Skin**: Fragmentary scale impressions known. No osteoderms confirmed.

   Brown 1908 and revised by Arbour & Currie 2013.

2. **CMN 8880** — Canadian Museum of Nature, Ottawa
   Skull and partial skeleton; another key specimen for *A. magniventris*.
   Provides good data on skull ornamentation and horn positions.

3. **Arbour & Currie 2015** (PLOS ONE, doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0138258)
   Tail club biomechanics study. Club could generate sufficient force to
   fracture bone of large theropods. Active weapon — not merely passive.
   Includes reconstructed swing mechanics.

4. **Arbour & Currie 2013** (Journal of Systematic Palaeontology)
   Comprehensive revision of *Ankylosaurus*. Best modern anatomical
   description. Essential for skull proportions and armor layout.

5. **Burns et al. 2011** (various)
   Osteoderm ontogeny and distribution. Back and flanks heavily armoured;
   belly was comparatively unprotected — soft ventral region.

6. **Schweitzer et al. (various)** — Ankylosaur skin texture documentation
   Osteoderms (keeled scutes, flat oval scutes) fully covering dorsal
   surface. Photograph surface textures of any ankylosaur specimens
   available at AMNH, RTMP, CMN.

7. **Royal Tyrrell Museum** — Drumheller, Alberta
   Extensive ankylosaur collection including *Euoplocephalus* (close
   relative). Textures from *Euoplocephalus* are the best available proxy
   for *Ankylosaurus* integument. RTMP 80.16.1 is a key skin reference.

## What to look for / photograph / scan

- **Tail club**: Bony knob at tail end (handle vertebrae fused); actively
  swung laterally. Proportionally large and heavy — do not undersize.
- **Armor**: Keeled oval scutes over back and sides in regular rows; large
  horn-like scutes at the shoulders and hips. Small mosaic ossicles fill
  gaps. No armor on belly — soft underside is a vulnerability.
- **Skull**: Wide, triangular, heavily armoured; fused osteoderms on skull
  surface form distinct polygonal bosses. Small, leaf-shaped teeth; broad
  beak. Skull is nearly as wide as long.
- **Posture**: Low to ground; wide-gauge quadrupedal stance; barrel body.
  Forelimbs slightly shorter than hindlimbs.
- **Limbs**: Columnar and robust; five toes on hind feet; broad, flat foot.
- **Texture detail**: Photograph osteoderm keels and surface texture in
  raking light. Scale impressions between osteoderms are useful.

   membrane shape and proportions.

3. **Bennett 2001** (Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology)
   Comprehensive monograph on *Pteranodon* taxonomy and sexual dimorphism.
   Males: large crests, narrow pelvis. Females: small/no crests, wider
   pelvis for egg-laying. Essential for sex-specific depiction.

4. **Habib 2008** (Zitteliana)
   Quadrupedal launch biomechanics — *Pteranodon* launched like a pole-
   vaulter, using all four limbs, hindlimbs last. Did NOT run and flap.
   Critical for any take-off or landing pose.

5. **Witton 2013** — *Pterosaurs: Natural History, Evolution, Anatomy*
   Princeton University Press. Best single reference for pterosaur life
   appearance, wing proportions, and locomotion. Includes *Pteranodon*
   chapter with up-to-date reconstruction.

6. **Pycnofibers documentation** — *Pteranodon* and pterosaurs generally
   were covered in pycnofibers: short, hair-like filaments. These are NOT
   feathers. Different structure, different evolutionary origin.

7. **Kellner et al. (various)** — Wing membrane studies
   Actinofibrils (stiff fibres) in the patagium created a semi-rigid wing.
   The wing attached to the ankle or upper hindlimb (debate ongoing).

## What to look for / photograph / scan

- **Crest**: Backward-projecting bony crest on male skulls; highly variable
  between individuals. In life, crest may have extended further with soft
  tissue. No soft-tissue crest evidence in females.
- **Wing membrane**: Attached from elongated fourth finger to body/hindlimb.
  Patagium was not a simple sheet — it had internal actinofibrils for
  stiffness and camber control.
- **Toothless beak**: No teeth — long, pointed beak for catching fish.
- **Body size**: Wingspan ~5–6 m (males); body was relatively small and
  lightweight (~25 kg estimated).
- **Pycnofibers**: Short, stiff fibers cover the body. Photograph any
  pterosaur specimens showing soft-tissue fiber preservation (Sordes,
  Jeholopterus have good examples).
- **Ground posture**: Quadrupedal at rest; wings folded against body.
  Hindlimbs smaller but functional; plantigrade or semi-plantigrade stance.

   Snout material; one of the well-documented post-Stromer specimens.
   Published in Dal Sasso et al. 2005. Conical, elongated crocodile-like
   snout confirmed; rosette of teeth at tip.

2. **Ibrahim et al. 2014** (Science, doi:10.1126/science.1258750)
   Landmark semi-aquatic reconstruction paper. Describes short hindlimbs,
   dense (pachyostotic) bones, and elevated nares position. Introduced
   the quadrupedal "gorilla posture" interpretation. Key images available.

3. **Ibrahim et al. 2020** (Nature, doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2190-3)
   Paddle-tail reconstruction. New specimen from Kem Kem shows elongated
   neural spines on tail vertebrae forming a large fin-like paddle.
   Primary swimming organ interpretation. This is the current standard
   for tail reconstruction.

4. **Hone & Holtz 2021** (Palaeontologia Electronica)
   Critical reassessment — argues for wading/shoreline predator rather
   than fully aquatic. Debate is ongoing. Note this uncertainty in any
   strictly aquatic depictions.

5. **Kem Kem Beds specimens** — Multiple fragmentary specimens from
   Morocco/Algeria (Kem Kem Group, Cenomanian). Various institutions
   hold material. The National Geographic Society funded the Ibrahim 2020
   excavation.

6. **Stromer 1915 original description** (Abhandlungen der Königlichen
   Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften) — Available in translation.
   Provides original documentation of the destroyed holotype. Scale
   drawings by Stromer are the only direct record of those specimens.

7. **Scale impressions** — Conical scales documented from available
   *Spinosaurus* specimens. Not smooth-skinned; not feathered.

## What to look for / photograph / scan

- **Skull**: Long, narrow, low profile — crocodilian analogue. Conical,
  interlocking teeth (not serrated blades). Enlarged conical teeth at snout
  tip (rosette). Nares positioned posteriorly/dorsally on skull.
- **Neural spines**: Elongated spines on dorsal vertebrae forming a sail
  or hump. Scale and shape still debated — sail vs. muscular hump.
  On tail: enlarged into paddle-like structure (Ibrahim 2020).
- **Hindlimbs**: Notably short relative to body length compared to other
  large theropods. Proportionally stubby.
- **Forelimbs**: Large, three-fingered; used in quadrupedal locomotion on
  land per Ibrahim 2014 interpretation. Claws robust.
- **Aquatic adaptations**: Dense bones; paddle tail; possible swimming
  stroke analogous to modern crocodilians.
- **Scale texture**: Conical scales on available specimens. Photograph
  any specimen with scale impressions at high magnification.

## Image format guidance
- Minimum 4K (3840×2160)

# Parasaurolophus — Reference Materials

## What this folder is for
This folder holds all scientific reference materials for *Parasaurolophus
walkeri* (and *P. tubicen*, *P. cyrtocristatus*): skeletal diagrams, fossil
photographs, crest acoustics studies, skin impression data (from close
relatives), and museum specimen images. All content here supports
scientifically accurate prompt engineering.

## File naming convention
```
parasaurolophus_[type]_[source]_[year].[ext]
```
Types: `skeletal`, `fossil`, `reconstruction`, `museum`, `texture`

Examples:
- `parasaurolophus_skeletal_rom768_scan.tif`
- `parasaurolophus_fossil_fmnh_p27393_2009.tif`
- `parasaurolophus_reconstruction_weishampel_1981.tif`

Image format: minimum 4K resolution; RAW preferred; TIF for scans.

## Priority reference materials

1. **ROM 768** — Royal Ontario Museum, Toronto
   Type specimen of *P. walkeri* (Parks 1922). This is the reference
   standard for the species. Complete skull with full posterior crest.
   Photograph from lateral and dorsal angles.

2. **FMNH P27393** — Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago
   Well-preserved specimen. Good for body proportions and postcranial
   reference. Field Museum mounts are well-maintained and accessible.

3. **Weishampel 1981** (Paleobiology)
   Crest acoustics paper — modelled the hollow crest as a resonating
   chamber producing low-frequency sound, possibly infrasound. While
   the exact acoustic properties are debated, the resonation function
   is the current consensus. Important context for crest depiction.

4. **Evans et al. 2009** (PLOS ONE, doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0006290)
   Juvenile ontogeny — crest was absent or rudimentary in juveniles and
   grew throughout ontogeny. A juvenile *Parasaurolophus* looks very
   different from an adult. Critical for age-accurate depiction.

5. **Edmontosaurus mummy specimens** (closely related hadrosaurid)
   **AMNH 5060** and **Senckenberg "Leonardo" (MOR 1128)** provide skin
   texture reference. Pebbly mosaic scales with possible pattern variation.
   Use as proxy for *Parasaurolophus* integument.

6. **Horner et al. 2004** (various) — Hadrosaur locomotion and posture
   *Parasaurolophus* was facultatively bipedal: bipedal at speed, could
   drop to all fours at low speed or foraging. Tail held horizontal as
   counterbalance during bipedal locomotion.

7. **Kirtland Formation specimens (New Mexico)**
   *P. tubicen* specimens from NM Museum of Natural History and Science
   (NMMNH). Complement ROM 768 for species variation reference.

## What to look for / photograph / scan

- **Crest**: Long, backward-pointing hollow tube crest in adults; crest
  shape varies by species (*walkeri* is long and straight; *tubicen* is
  longer; *cyrtocristatus* is shorter and curved). Crest is hollow — not
  solid bone. Absent/small in juveniles.
- **Skull**: Duck-billed (wide, flat dental battery); toothless beak at
  front; hundreds of teeth in grinding battery. Large orbit.
- **Skin**: Pebbly mosaic scales based on hadrosaur mummy reference.
  Possible patterned coloration (Edmontosaurus mummies show scale texture
  variation that implies pattern). No feathers.
- **Locomotion posture**: Bipedal when running (tail out for balance);
  quadrupedal when slow/foraging. Not fully bipedal at all times.
- **Tail**: Muscular, horizontal; relatively deep from neural spines;
  active counterbalance in bipedal posture.
- **Forelimbs**: Hoof-like manus for weight-bearing when quadrupedal;
  three functional fingers fused into a padded weight-bearing structure.

## Image format guidance
- Minimum 4K (3840×2160)
- RAW preferred for museum photography
- TIF for skeletal and crest cross-section diagram scans
- CT scan data of ROM 768 crest (published) is useful reference for crest interior

# Dilophosaurus — Reference Materials

## What this folder is for
This folder holds all scientific reference materials for *Dilophosaurus
wetherilli*: skeletal diagrams, fossil photographs, crest morphology studies,
locomotion data, and museum specimen images. All content here supports
scientifically accurate prompt engineering.

**CRITICAL ACCURACY WARNING — Jurassic Park depiction is incorrect**:
*Dilophosaurus* in Jurassic Park (1993) was depicted with a neck frill and
venom-spitting ability. NEITHER has any scientific basis:
- **No frill**: No frill attachment structures exist in any *Dilophosaurus*
  specimen. The frill was pure Hollywood invention.
- **No venom**: No venom delivery structures (grooved/hollow teeth, venom
  glands) are known in any theropod dinosaur.
These errors must never appear in any reconstruction derived from this
reference collection.

## Priority reference materials

1. **UCMP 37302** — University of California Museum of Paleontology, Berkeley
   Holotype specimen described by Welles 1954. Partial postcranial skeleton.
   This specimen established *D. wetherilli* as a valid species.

2. **Welles 1984** (Palaeontographica Abteilung A)
   Full redescription and revision of *Dilophosaurus wetherilli*. The
   authoritative anatomical reference for the species. Essential reading
   before any reconstruction work. Confirms NO frill, NO venom structures.

3. **Marsh 2020 comprehensive revision** — Adam Marsh's detailed
   re-examination of all *Dilophosaurus* specimens from the Kayenta
   Formation. Updates Welles 1984 with CT scanning and modern methods.
   Best current source for skull and crest anatomy.

4. **MNA V2623** — Museum of Northern Arizona, Flagstaff AZ
   Specimen from the original Kayenta Formation quarry site. MNA holds
   significant *Dilophosaurus* material from Navajo Nation lands.

5. **Parsons & Parsons 2009** (various)
   Postcranial material and locomotion inferences. *Dilophosaurus* was an
   active, long-legged biped — one of the larger Early Jurassic theropods.

6. **IVPP material — *Dilophosaurus sinensis*** — Institute of Vertebrate
   Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, Beijing
   Chinese specimens from Yunnan Province. Second species (or close
   relative). Useful for comparative reference and variation.

7. **Early Jurassic theropod context** — Compare with *Coelophysis*
   (AMNH collections) and *Zupaysaurus* for proportional reference within
   early theropod body plans.

## What to look for / photograph / scan

- **Double crests**: Two parallel, longitudinal crests on top of the skull.
  Thin, fragile bone — likely for display/species recognition only. Cannot
  have been used for combat (too fragile). No frill attachment fossae.
- **Skull**: Large, lightly built; relatively long; notch in upper jaw
  behind the front teeth (subnarial gap) — unusual feature. Small, blade-
  like serrated teeth.
- **Body proportions**: Lightly built for its size; long hindlimbs; long
  neck; relatively long arms with three large-clawed fingers plus a reduced
  fourth.
- **Forelimbs**: Three functional clawed fingers; arms long relative to
  later theropods. Palms face each other (medially).
- **Feathering**: Uncertain — possible proto-feathers (as in *Sinosauropteryx*
  grade). No direct evidence known, but phylogenetic position makes it
  plausible. Skin impressions are unknown.
- **Tail**: Long, horizontal counterbalance; important for bipedal balance.
- **Overall impression**: Gracile, active predator — more lightly built
  than later large theropods. Think falcon-like in movement quality.
